The InfinitySwap (IS20) token standard is based on the Ethereum ERC20 standard and shares a very similar interface,
where possible to DIP20.

# IS20 specific methods

## Transaction notifications

IS20 offers a way to reliably inform the receiver of a transaction about the transaction. To do it, we
introduce a `notify` method. It sends an `update` call `transaction_notifiction` to the
receiving principal, with the details about the transaction. A notification can only be sent once for each
transaction, preventing possibility of duplicate call attack.

### Notify

```
update notify(transactionId: nat) -> TxReceipt
```

Notifies the transaction receiver about a previously performed transaction.

This method guarantees that a notification for the same transaction id can be sent only once.
It allows to use this method to reliably inform the transaction receiver without danger of
duplicate transaction attack.

In case the notification call fails, an `TxError::NotificationFailed` error is returned and
the transaction will still be marked as not notified.

If a notification request is made for a transaction that was already notified, a
`TxError::AlreadyNotified` error is returned.

### Transfer and notify

```
update transfer_and_notify(to: principal, amount: nat) -> TxReceipt
```


Convenience method to make a transaction and notify the receiver with just one call.

If the notification fails for any reason, the transaction is still completed, but it will be
marked as not notified, so a [notify] call can be done later to re-request the notification of
this transaction.

### Notification call interface

This is the interface for the notification call that is made by the token canister for the receiver
canister. This method is not part of the token canister API.

```
type TransactionNotification = record {
    tx_id: nat;
    from: principal;
    token_id: principal;
    amount: nat;
}

update transaction_notification(notification: TransactionNotification) -> ()
```
