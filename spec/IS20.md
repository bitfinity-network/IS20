The InfinitySwap (IS20) token standard is based on the Ethereum ERC20 standard and shares a very similar interface,
where possible to DIP20.

# IS20 specific methods

## Transaction notifications

IS20 offers a way to reliably inform the receiver of a transaction about the transaction. To do it, we
introduce a `notify` method. It sends an `update` call `transaction_notifiction` to the
receiving principal, with the details about the transaction. A notification can only be sent once for each
transaction, preventing possibility of duplicate call attack.

### Notify

```
update notify(transactionId: nat) -> TxReceipt
```

Notifies the transaction receiver about a previously performed transaction.

This method guarantees that a notification for the same transaction id can be sent only once.
It allows to use this method to reliably inform the transaction receiver without danger of
duplicate transaction attack.

In case the notification call fails, an `TxError::NotificationFailed` error is returned and
the transaction will still be marked as not notified.

If a notification request is made for a transaction that was already notified, a
`TxError::AlreadyNotified` error is returned.

### Transfer and notify

```
update transfer_and_notify(to: principal, amount: nat) -> TxReceipt
```


Convenience method to make a transaction and notify the receiver with just one call.

If the notification fails for any reason, the transaction is still completed, but it will be
marked as not notified, so a [notify] call can be done later to re-request the notification of
this transaction.

### Notification call interface

This is the interface for the notification call that is made by the token canister for the receiver
canister. This method is not part of the token canister API.

```
type TransactionNotification = record {
    tx_id: nat;
    from: principal;
    token_id: principal;
    amount: nat;
}

update transaction_notification(notification: TransactionNotification) -> ()
```

## Cycle auctions

As the IC canisters must pay cycles for all operations it performs, as well as for the HD storage
it uses, it's essential to make sure that the token canister always have enough cycles to run. One
way to do it is to require the canister owner to monitor the canister and top it up with cycles
when needed. This approach, although simple, does not allow the tokens to be fully decentralized.

IS20 provides a mechanism of cycle auctions, that doesn't require owner's attention for the
canister cycle management.

Cycle auctions are run in a set intervals, and allow any user to add cycles to the canister and
get a portion of the transaction fees as the reward for doing so.

The main concepts of the mechanism are:
* `fee_ratio` is the proportion of the fees that will be distributed among the auction participants.
  This ratio is set at the end of each auction based on the current amount of cycles in the canister,
  and a `min_cycles` value, set by the owner. The ratio is `1.0` if the amount of cycles available is
  `min_cycles` or less, and exponentially decreases as the available amount of cycles increases.
  The value of `1.0` means that all the fees will be used for the next cycle auction, and the value
  of `0.5` means that half of the cycles will go to the owner while the other half will be used
  for the auction.
* `auction_period` - minimum period of time between two consecutive auctions. The default value
  is 1 day, but can be changed by the owner of the canister.
* `accumulated_fees` - the transaction fees, collected since the last auction was held. This amount
  of tokens will be distributed at the next auction.
* `total_cycles` - the amount of cycles that were bid since the last auction. This value is used
  to calculate what portion of the `accumulated_fees` each participant will get. For example,
  if _Billy_ made a bid of `1e9` cycles, and the `total_cycles` for the auction is `1e10`, he will
  get 10% of `accumulated_fees`.

### Types

```
type AuctionError = variant {
  TooEarly;
  NoBids;
  NotFound;
  BiddingTooSmall;
};

type AuctionInfo = record {
  auction_time : nat64;
  auction_id : nat64;
  first_transaction_id : nat;
  last_transaction_id : nat;
  tokens_distributed : nat;
  cycles_collected : nat64;
  fee_ratio : float64;
};

type BiddingInfo = record {
  caller_cycles : nat64;
  auction_period : nat64;
  accumulated_fees : nat;
  last_auction : nat64;
  total_cycles : nat64;
  fee_ratio : float64;
};
```

### Bid cycles

```
update bidCycles() -> variant { Ok : nat64; Err: AuctionError }
```

Bid cycles for the next cycle auction.

This method must be called with the cycles provided in the call. The amount of cycles cannot be
less than 1_000_000. The provided cycles are accepted by the canister, and the user bid is
saved for the next auction.

### Bidding info

```
query biddingInfo() -> BiddingInfo;
```

Current information about bids and auction.

### Start auction

```
update startAuction() -> variant { Ok : AuctionInfo; Err: AuctionError }
```

Starts the cycle auction.

This method can be called only once in a `BiddingState.auction_period`. If the time elapsed
since the last auction is less than the set period, `AuctionError::TooEarly` will be returned.

The auction will distribute the accumulated fees in proportion to the user cycle bids, and
then will update the fee ratio until the next auction.

### Auction info

```
update auctionInfo(auction_id: nat32) -> vairant { Ok : AuctionInfo; Err: AuctionError }
```

Returns the information about a previously held auction.

### Get min cycles

```
query getMinCycles() -> nat64
```

Returns the minimum cycles set for the canister.

This value affects the fee ratio set by the auctions. The more cycles available in the canister
the less proportion of the fees will be transferred to the auction participants. If the amount
of cycles in the canister drops below this value, all the fees will be used for cycle auction.

### Set min cycles

```
update setMinCycles(min_cycles: nat64) -> variant { Ok; Err: TxError }
```

Sets the minimum cycles for the canister. For more information about this value, read [get_min_cycles].

Only the owner is allowed to call this method.

### Set auction period

```
update setAuctionPeriod(period_sec: nat64) -> variant { Ok; Err: TxError }
```

Sets the minimum time between two consecutive auctions, in seconds.

Only the owner is allowed to call this method.
