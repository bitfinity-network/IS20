# Token Standard Spec

The InfinitySwap (IS20) token standard is based on the Ethereum ERC20 standard and is compatible
with the DIP20 token standard.

The main additions to the DIP20 are [transaction notification](#Transaction notifications)
and [cycle auction](#Cycle auctions) methods. All other changes in comparison to DIP20 marked in
this document with `DIP20 compatability` note.

# Rational

ERC20 is a well established and widely used token standard in Ethereum ecosystem. Internet Computer
environment introduces a few changes though, that do not allow using ERC20 tokens in IC as is:

1. Reverse gas model, requiring the token smart contracts (canisters) to pay for all incoming requests.
   This makes it possible to drain the canister of cycles with a lot of empty update calls.
2. Asynchronous nature of all inter-canister calls make it impossible to use ERC20 tokens in operations
   like AMM flash swaps.

To deal with the first issue, IS20 adds the notion of transaction fee. This fee is set by the canister
owner and is collected on each transaction. A portion of the fee is then used for cycle auctions,
providing decentralized method to provide cycles for the canister.

# Message inspection

To prevent possible DDOS attacks, the IS20 allows any update methods to reject ingress messages if the request seems
unreasonable. In this case IC will return `403` error to the caller.

The default implementation introduces following checks:

* all methods that are available only for the owner are rejected, if the caller is not the owner
* all transaction methods are rejected, if the calling user does not have any balance
* cycles auction can be run only by the owner or by any of the cycle bidders


# History limit

The stored transaction history can be limited to some value. The older transactions than can be removed
from the storage and be forgotten about. If such transactions are queried, an empty response is
produced.

The default implementation has the history length limit of `1 000 000` entries.

# ICRC-1 Token Standard.

The new ICRC-1 token standard has new changes to accounts, a principal can have multiple accounts. Each account of a
principal
is identified by a 32-byte string called subaccount. Therefore, an account corresponds to
a `pair (principal, subaccount)`
.

The account identified by the subaccount with all bytes set to 0 is the default account of the principal.

### AccountIdentifier

`AccountIdentifier` is composed of a `principal` and a `subaccount`.

### Subaccount

`Subaccount` is a 32-byte string. It is used to identify an account of a `principal`.

# API specification

## Data Structures

1. Metadata: basic token information

```
type Metadata = {
   name : text; // token name
   symbol : text; // token symbol
   decimals : nat8; // token decimal
   totalSupply : Tokens128; // token total supply
   owner : principal; // token owner
   logo : text; // base64 encoded logo or logo url
   fee : Tokens128; // fee for update calls
}
```

2. TxError: error response for transaction related methods.

```
type TxError = variant {
    InsufficientBalance,
    Unauthorized,
    AmountTooSmall,
    FeeExceededLimit,
    AlreadyActioned,
    BadFee,
    InsufficientFunds,
    TxTooOld,
    TxCreatedInFuture,
    TxDuplicate,
    SelfTransfer,
    AmountOverflow,
    AccountNotFound,
    ClaimNotAllowed,
    GenericError
};
```



`AmountTooSmall` is also not part of DIP20 spec, but it only be returned by IS20 method `transfer_include_fee`.

3. TxRecord: transaction history record

```
type Operation = variant {
  Burn;
  Mint;
  Auction;
  Transfer;
};

type TransactionStatus = variant {
  Failed;
  Succeeded
};

type TxRecord = record {
  fee : Tokens128;
  status : TransactionStatus;
  from_details : opt(Principal, Subaccount);
  to_details : opt (Principal, Subaccount);
  operation : Operation;
  timestamp : int;
  caller : Principal;
  index : Tokens128;
  amount : Tokens128;
};
```

3. Transfer Arguments

```
type TransferArgs = record {
  from_subaccount : opt Subaccount;
  to : Principal;
  to_subaccount : opt Subaccount;
  amount : Tokens128;
  fee : opt Tokens128;
  memo : opt u64;
  created_at_time : opt Timestamp;
};

type Timestamp = int;

```



## 2. Basic Interfaces

### Update calls

The update calls described in this section might choose to charge `fee` amount of tokens to prevent DDoS attack, this is
necessary because of the reverse gas model of the IC. All update functions are allowed to trap, instead of returning an
error in order to take advantage of the canisters automatic, atomic state rollback.

#### transfer methods

##### icrc1_transfer

This transfer method has optional `to_subaccount` and `from_subaccount`, if both are specified, the transfer happens
between the two subaccount.
It transfers `value` amount of tokens from the `from` subaccount to the `to` subaccount.
If one of the subaccount is specified either as `to` or `from`, the transfer happens to the specified subaccount.
if neither `to` nor `from` subaccount is specified, the transfer happens `to` Principal .

`memo` provides a way to attach a message to the transaction.

This method returns a `TxReceipt` which contains the transaction index or an error message. The balance of the caller is
reduced by `value + fee` amount.

To protect the caller from unexpected fee amount change, the optional `fee_limit` parameter can be given. If the
fee to be applied is larger than this value, the transaction will fail with `TxError::FeeExceededLimit` error.

```
update icrc1_tranfer(transfer: TransferArgs) -> TxReceipt;
```

#### transferIncludeFee

##### icrc1_transferIncludeFee

This transfer method has optional `to_subaccount` and `from_subaccount`, if both are specified, the transfer happens
between the two subaccount.
It transfers `value` amount of tokens from the `from` subaccount to the `to` subaccount.
If one of the subaccount is specified either as `to_subaccount` or `from_subaccount`, the transfer happens to the
specified subaccount.
if neither `to` nor `from` subaccount is specified, the transfer happens `to` Principal .

This method returns a `TxReceipt` which contains the transaction index or an error message. The sender account is
reduced
by `value`, the receiver account is increased by `value + fee` amount.

Note, that the `value` cannot be less than the `fee` amount. If the value given is too small,
transaction will fail with `TxError::AmountTooSmall` error.

```
update icrc1_transferIncludeFee(from_subaccount: opt Subaccount, to: Principal, to_subaccount: opt Subaccount, amount: Tokens128, fee_limit: opt Tokens128) -> TxReceipt;
```

#### batchTransfer

Transfers the specified amount to a list of principals. This operation is transactional, meaning that either all or none
of the transfers will be executed. The fee (if configured by the token) is taken from every transaction, so total fee
amount will be `transfers.len() * fee`.

The balance of the caller is reduced by sum of `value + fee` amount for each transfer. If the total sum of `value + fee`
for all transfers,
is less than the `balance` of the caller, the transaction will fail with `TxError::InsufficientBalance` error.

```
update batchTransfer(transfers: vec record {principal, Tokens128}) : enum { ok : vec Tokens128; err : TxError }
```

### Query calls

#### getTransaction

Returns transaction detail of the transaction identified by `index`. If the `index` is out of range, the execution
traps. Transactions are indexed from zero.

```
query func getTransaction(index: u128) : TxRecord
```

#### getTransactions

Returns a list of transactions in paginated form. The `who` is optional and returns the transactions of the specified
principal, including the transactions occuring from subaccounts.
`count` is the number of transactions to return, `transaction_id` is the transaction index which is used as
the offset of the first transaction to return.

It returns `PaginatedResult` a struct, which contains `result` which is a list of transactions `Vec<TxRecord>` that meet
the requirements of the query,
and `next_id` which is the index of the next transaction to return.

```
query getTransactions(who: opt principal,  count: u32, transaction_id: opt u128) : PaginatedResult
```

#### name

Returns the name of the token.

OPTIONAL: the consumers of the API must not expect this value to be present.

```
query icrc1_name() : text
```

#### logo

Returns the logo of the token as URL link or base64 encoded image (with "base64,..." prefix).

OPTIONAL: the consumers of the API must not expect this value to be present.

```
query logo() : Text
```

#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token, e.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL: the consumers of the API must not expect this value to be present.

```
query icrc1_symbol() : text
```

#### decimals

Returns the decimals of the token, e.g. `8` means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its
user representation.

OPTIONAL: the consumers of the API must not expect this value to be present.

```
query icrc1_decimals() : async nat8
```

#### icrc1_total_supply

Returns the total supply of the token.

```
query icrc1_total_supply() : Tokens128
```

#### icrc1_balance_of

##### (icrc1 standard)

Returns the balance of user `who` and optional `who_subaccount` if specified.

```
type BalanceArgs {
  of: Principal;
  subaccount: opt Subaccount;
}

```
query icrc1_balance_of(args: BalanceArgs) : Tokens128
```

#### getMetadata

Returns the metadata of the token.

```
query getMetadata() : Metadata
```
##### icrc1_metadata (icrc1 standard)

Returns the metadata of the token.

```
type Value = variant { Nat : nat; Int : int; Text : text; Blob : blob };
icrc1_metadata : () -> (vec { record { text; Value } }) query;

```

#### historySize

Returns the history size.

```
query historySize() : u64
```

#### owner

Returns the owner of the canister.

```
query owner() -> principal;
```

## Optional interfaces

### Update calls

#### mint

##### mint

Mint `value` number of new tokens to user `to` with their respective subaccount if specified, if the `to_subaccount` is not specified, the `value` is minted to the default subaccount.


```
update icrc1_mint(to: principal, to_subaccount: opt Subaccount , value: Tokens128): TxReceipt
```

#### burn

##### burn

Burn `value` number of new tokens from user `from` with their respective specified subaccount, if `from_subaccount` is not specified, the tokens will be burned from the defauly `from` subaccount, this will decrease the token total supply, only `owner` or the
user `from` him/herself can perform this operation.
If `from` is not set, then caller's tokens will be burned.
If `from` is given but method called not by owner, `TxError::Unauthorized` will be returned.
If owner calls this method and `from` is set to `Bob`, then `Bob`'s tokens will be burned.

```
update icrc1_burn(from: opt principal, from_subaccount: opt Subaccount, value: Tokens128): TxReceipt
```

`aaaaa-aa` is the IC management canister id, it's not a real canister, just an abstraction of system level management
functions, it can be used as Blackhole address.

#### setName

Change the name of the token, no return value needed.

```
update setName(name: text)
```

#### setSymbol

Change the name of the token, no return value needed.

```
update setSymbol(symbol: text)
```

#### setLogo

Change the logo of the token, no return value needed. The `logo` can either be a base64 encoded text of the logo picture
or an URL pointing to the logo picture.

```
update setLogo(logo: text)
```

#### setFee

Set fee to `newFee` for update calls(`approve`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`), no return value needed.

```
update setFee(newFee: nat)
```

#### setFeeTo

```
update setFeeTo(newFeeTo: principal)
```

#### setOwner

Set the owner of the token to `newOwner`, no return value needed.

```
update setOwner(newOwner: principal)
```

### Query calls

#### getUserTransactionAmount

Returns total number of transactions related to the user `who`, it returns with all the transactions of the user, including the transactions of subaccounts.



```
query getUserTransactionAmount(who: principal) : async Tokens128
```


## Cycle auctions

As the IC canisters must pay cycles for all operations it performs, as well as for the HD storage it uses, it's
essential to make sure that the token canister always have enough cycles to run. One way to do it is to require the
canister owner to monitor the canister and top it up with cycles when needed. This approach, although simple, does not
allow the tokens to be fully decentralized.

IS20 provides a mechanism of cycle auctions, that doesn't require owner's attention for the canister cycle management.

Cycle auctions are run in a set intervals, and allow any user to add cycles to the canister and get a portion of the
transaction fees as the reward for doing so.

The main concepts of the mechanism are:

* `fee_ratio` is the proportion of the fees that will be distributed among the auction participants. This ratio is set
  at the end of each auction based on the current amount of cycles in the canister, and a `min_cycles` value, set by the
  owner. The ratio is `1.0` if the amount of cycles available is
  `min_cycles` or less, and exponentially decreases as the available amount of cycles increases. The value of `1.0`
  means that all the fees will be used for the next cycle auction, and the value of `0.5` means that half of the cycles
  will go to the owner while the other half will be used for the auction.
* `auction_period` - minimum period of time between two consecutive auctions. The default value is 1 day, but can be
  changed by the owner of the canister.
* `accumulated_fees` - the transaction fees, collected since the last auction was held. This amount of tokens will be
  distributed at the next auction.
* `total_cycles` - the amount of cycles that were bid since the last auction. This value is used to calculate what
  portion of the `accumulated_fees` each participant will get. For example, if _Billy_ made a bid of `1e9` cycles, and
  the `total_cycles` for the auction is `1e10`, he will get 10% of `accumulated_fees`.

### Types

```
type AuctionError = variant {
  TooEarly;
  NoBids;
  NotFound;
  BiddingTooSmall;
};

type AuctionInfo = record {
  auction_time : nat64;
  auction_id : nat64;
  first_transaction_id : nat;
  last_transaction_id : nat;
  tokens_distributed : nat;
  cycles_collected : nat64;
  fee_ratio : float64;
};

type BiddingInfo = record {
  caller_cycles : nat64;
  auction_period : nat64;
  accumulated_fees : nat;
  last_auction : nat64;
  total_cycles : nat64;
  fee_ratio : float64;
};
```

#### bidCycles

Bid cycles for the next cycle auction.

This method must be called with the cycles provided in the call. The amount of cycles cannot be less than 1_000_000. The
provided cycles are accepted by the canister, and the user bid is saved for the next auction.

```
update bidCycles(bidder: principal) -> variant { Ok : nat64; Err: AuctionError }
```

### biddingInfo

Current information about bids and auction.

```
query biddingInfo() -> BiddingInfo;
```

### runAuction

Starts the cycle auction.

This method can be called only once in a `BiddingState.auction_period`. If the time elapsed since the last auction is
less than the set period, `AuctionError::TooEarly` will be returned.

The auction will distribute the accumulated fees in proportion to the user cycle bids, and then will update the fee
ratio until the next auction.

```
update startAuction() -> variant { Ok : AuctionInfo; Err: AuctionError }
```

### auctionInfo

Returns the information about a previously held auction.

```
update auctionInfo(auction_id: nat32) -> vairant { Ok : AuctionInfo; Err: AuctionError }
```

### getMinCycles

Returns the minimum cycles set for the canister.

This value affects the fee ratio set by the auctions. The more cycles available in the canister the less proportion of
the fees will be transferred to the auction participants. If the amount of cycles in the canister drops below this
value, all the fees will be used for cycle auction.

```
query getMinCycles() -> nat64
```

### setMinCycles

Sets the minimum cycles for the canister. For more information about this value, read [get_min_cycles].

Only the owner is allowed to call this method.

```
update setMinCycles(min_cycles: nat64) -> variant { Ok; Err: TxError }
```

### setAuctionPeriod

Sets the minimum time between two consecutive auctions, in seconds.

Only the owner is allowed to call this method.

```
update setAuctionPeriod(period_sec: nat64) -> variant { Ok; Err: TxError }
```
